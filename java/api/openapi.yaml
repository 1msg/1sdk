  description: "[1MSG.IO](https://1msg.io/) is the perfect WhatsApp management tool\
    \ for your business. With us you get full access to the official Whatsapp API/webhooks.\n\
    \nEvery API request must contain an Authorize HTTP header with a token. \nThis\
    \ is your channel token, which can be found in your channel project on your profile\
    \ page.\nPlease do not give the token to anyone or post it publicly.\n\nThe authorization\
    \ token must be added to each request in the GET parameter 'token' and always\
    \ passed to query string (?token={your_token}).\nParameters in GET queries pass\
    \ query string. Parameters in POST requests — through the JSON-encoded request\
    \ body. \n\nAll 'send' methods (except /sendTemplate) will only work when the\
    \ dialog session with the user is open. Some of our solutions simplify and avoid\
    \ such limitations, but we urge you to pay more attention to this detail"

        First, you need to upload your inventory to Facebook. You can use the API or Facebook’s Commerce Manager to do that. If you already have a Facebook catalog set up, we suggest that you leverage that catalog for WhatsApp commerce use cases.
